# ForeverUp
Windows tasks monitoring application which checks if a list of tasks are running at a regular interval and restarts them if they aren't.

It is heavly inspired from AlwaysUp (which is an amazing tool by the way, go check it out if you need a professionnal take on this) or other tools like the knas Restarter which was used to restart Counterstrike servers back in the days.
For now it only supports basic features but I will update it sometimes if I feel the need.
