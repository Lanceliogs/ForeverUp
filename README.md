# ForeverUp
Windows tasks monitoring application which checks if a list of tasks are running at a regular interval and restarts them if they aren't.

It is inspired from AlwaysUp (which is an amazing tool by the way, go check it out if you need a professionnal take on this) or other tools like the knas Restarter which was used to restart Counterstrike servers back in the days. I also took some dna from the Windows Task Scheduler to cook that tool.
For now it only supports basic features but I will update it sometimes if I feel the need.

Launch application at startup was done using William Rayer code on codeproject.com as a base, so huge claps to him.
